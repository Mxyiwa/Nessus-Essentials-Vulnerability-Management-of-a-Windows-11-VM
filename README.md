<h2>What is Vulnerability Management in Cybersecurity?</h2>


<b>According to Microsoft, Vulnerability Management is a continuous, proactive, and often automated process that keeps your computer systems, networks, and enterprise applications safe from cyberattacks and data breaches. As such, it is an important part of an overall security program. By identifying, assessing, and addressing potential security weaknesses, organisations can help prevent attacks and minimise damage if one does occur.

<br />
<br />
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how we can use Nessus Essentials as a tool for scanning for vulnerabilities on a computer and how we can discover and remediate these vulnerabilities 
<br />
